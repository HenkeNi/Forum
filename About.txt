********** HOW TO GO ABOUT BEING ABLE TO QUOTE OTHER USERS POSTS **********
I wanted to add the ability to quote other users posts inside a thread (just like any other forum).

How it's working now: 
  In the end I decided to make a quote its own table in the database (a table that contains the quoted-text, the author of the quote and so on)

Thoughts: 
  I thought about, instead of having a quote being its own table, it could also work saving the quoted text inside of the 
  current users message. So when the user is sending their message I would also add the message from the quoted post inside of some 
  custome [tags]. Ex:

  post.message:

  [quote]"This text is quoted from another user"[/quote]

  "This text is the text the current user is sending together with the quote"



  This way you could also extract the quote from the message without needing it to be its own db-table. The downside would be that it 
  could potentially be a bit harder to work with (extract the quote - especially if the quoted text already contains a quoted text).
  It wouldn't be very reponsive either - if the author of the quote changed their username, it wouldn't update in the quote.

  - not as reponsive (quote tabel will be updated if foreign keys gets updated, where hardcoded text will not)
  + Saves request to db...
 +/- Enables to quote a post that already contains a quote? Or it would cause a lot of problems....




*** HOW TO RESPOND TO A DELETED USER ***
How it's now:
  When a user gets deleted, instead of putting OnDelete => Cascade on the foreign keys inside the thread and posts tables and deleting
  all the posts and threads a user has created I decided to instead change the author to a default user called deleted_user. 

  The reason for this is that I didn't make a lot of sense to delete everything a user has made (posts and threads) just because
  they get deleted. For example, if a user has made a very popular thread it wouldn't make a lot of sense deleting it just because 
  the user was deleted.

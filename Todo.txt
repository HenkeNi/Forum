[Thoughts]

* instead of having quotes as its own table; save quoted message in post.message using [quote][/quote] tags?
  ex: [quote]This is quoted from another user[/quote]
  - Bit harder to work with
  - Harder to get data like when it was posted...
  - not as reponsive (quote tabel will be updated if foreign keys gets updated, where hardcoded text will not)
  + Saves request to db...
 +/- Enables to quote a post that already contains a quote? Or it would cause a lot of problems....
